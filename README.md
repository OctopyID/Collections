# Octopy Collection
This is one of the components needed by the Octopy Framework by using the component from [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/illuminate/collections).

For now we need the class below without any base code changes just a separate namespace.

- Arr
- Collection

## Installation

```
composer require octopyid/collections
```

## Credits

All credit goes to the Laravel Collection and all its active contributors.
